# juce_starter
a starter for building plugins with juce..

this simple gain slider plugin goes through the structure and set up for handling sliders correctly..
it also shows how to implement a for loop to gain sample by sample access to the data..

it goes over the constructor for each seperate file and tries to explain a little about what is happening
for those who are just starting out learning DSP!

hopefully this can be useful!

to start... look through editor.h and then editor.cpp and then processor.h and processor.cpp
